            For all of its complexity, blockchainâ€™s potential as a decentralized
            form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user
            privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer
            errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond
            those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages.
